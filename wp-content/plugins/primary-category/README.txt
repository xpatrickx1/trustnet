WordPress plugin for setting and displaying primary categories for posts and custom post types. This is a fork from Jacob McKinney's Primary Category, with a different UI that doesn't need to update the post in case of new category 

== Description ==

This plugin adds radiobuttons near every category (even if you add a new category) so you can choose the primary category of your post **. Selecting a primary category and updating the post saves this data into a custom field with a meta key of "primary_category".

To display a list of all posts with a particular primary category, use the shortcode [primary-category name="CATEGORY NAME" post_type="POST TYPE"] where CATEGORY NAME is the name of the primary category you wish to display and POST TYPE is the custom post type name. If a name is not specified, the shortcode will default to all posts with "uncategorized" set as the primary category. images or post.

2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` screen in WordPress
3. See the categories tab in your post or custom post edit page. Set the radiobutton near your preferred category.
